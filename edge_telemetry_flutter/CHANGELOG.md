# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Four new canon event names** — `ui.interaction`, `frame.summary`,
  `screen.load`, `task.complete`. The wire allowlist now holds 16 event names
  and 4 metric names; emitters land in their own releases.
- **The allowlist drop is visible.** Off-canon items are still dropped on the
  device (the allowlist is the one guard against an unbudgeted emitter), but the
  drop now prints under `debugMode: true` and increments a session-scoped
  counter that ships on the session's closing event as
  `session.dropped_item_count` and `session.dropped_reasons` (e.g.
  `off_canon=7`). Seven of v2.0.0's own internal emissions were dropped on every
  device for the whole release and were found by audit rather than by telemetry;
  this is the fix for the silence, not for the drop.

### Changed

- **Collection is now two fields: `tier` and `captureOverrides`.**
  `tier: CollectionTier.essential | standard | diagnostic` is the dial;
  `captureOverrides: Map<Capture, bool>` is the scalpel and works in both
  directions (`{Capture.swipes: true}` adds, `{Capture.http: false}` removes).
  A tier is an on/off plus a shed rank, never a sampling axis — `sampleRate`
  remains one roll per session.
- **A budget governor sheds whole tiers** — `diagnostic`, then `standard`,
  never `essential` — once a session crosses its item ceiling, and counts every
  shed on the existing `session.dropped_item_count` /
  `session.dropped_reasons` (`tier_shed=N`) that ships on the session's closing
  event.
- **`trackEvent` / `trackMetric` take `Map<String, Object?>?`** instead of
  `dynamic`. Values are stringified as before, so `{'count': 3, 'ok': true}`
  keeps compiling and the bytes on the wire are unchanged. The `toJson()`
  reflection fallback is deleted — passing an arbitrary object is no longer a
  supported attribute shape.

### Removed

- **`enableCrashReporting` and `enableErrorReporting` are removed outright** —
  from `initialize()` and from `TelemetryConfig`. This is a deliberate hard
  compile break, not a silent no-op: a consumer who had deliberately suppressed
  crash reporting must not begin transmitting because of a `pub upgrade`. Crash
  and error capture are unconditional in v3, and `Capture` has no member for
  either — an SDK reporting no crashes must never be indistinguishable from one
  configured not to. If the concern is volume, use
  `tier: CollectionTier.essential`; if it is privacy, note that `app.crash`
  carries no arbitrary consumer attributes.
- `initialize(useJsonFormat:)` and `TelemetryConfig.useJsonFormat` — the SDK has
  been custom-JSON only since v2.0.0. **The `TelemetryConfig` field never
  carried a `@Deprecated` annotation**, so a consumer who constructed the class
  by hand gets a compile error with no deprecation cycle behind it. Named here
  rather than left to the compiler.
- `initialize(batchTimeout:/maxBatchSize:/eventBatchSize:)` and the matching
  `TelemetryConfig` fields — use `flushIntervalMs` and `batchSize`.
- `withSpan()` / `withNetworkSpan()` — OTel-era no-ops that recorded nothing.

### Deprecated

Deprecated-in-place, still honoured as a fallback (the new key always wins), and
**removed in v4.0.0** — annotated on the facade parameter *and* the
`TelemetryConfig` field:

| v2 | v3 |
|---|---|
| `enableHttpMonitoring: false` | `captureOverrides: {Capture.http: false}` |
| `enableNavigationTracking: false` | `captureOverrides: {Capture.navigation: false}` |
| `enablePerformanceMonitoring: false` | `captureOverrides: {Capture.frames: false, Capture.health: false}` |
| `enableNetworkMonitoring: false` | `captureOverrides: {Capture.connectivity: false}` |
| `captureAccessibilityContext: true` | `captureOverrides: {Capture.accessibilityContext: true}` |

`enableLocalReporting` is **not** deprecated: it gates a sink (the on-device
report store), not a capture, and never touches the wire.

### Errata

- **`enableErrorReporting` has had no effect since v2.0.0.** Error capture has
  been unconditional since that release — `initialize()` never exposed the
  parameter and hardcoded the config field to `true`. This was not disclosed at
  the time.
- **`TelemetryConfig.hasAutomaticMonitoring` could never return `false`** in
  v2.0.0, because it OR'd `enableErrorReporting`, which was always `true`. It
  now reports whether any capture is actually enabled.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-13

**The wire changed — your code mostly didn't.** This is the atomic v2.0.0:
OpenTelemetry is gone, the wire is aligned to the Edge RUM family canon, native
crash capture (iOS + Android) is in, and the 1251-line barrel god-object is
split into the family's 5-layer architecture. For the common consumer the
upgrade is a two-line checklist, not an investigation.

### 🧭 Migrating from 1.x — the whole checklist

1. **Bump the iOS Podfile floor to 14** (`platform :ios, '14.0'`). Required by
   MetricKit native crash capture — this is the one guaranteed build break.
2. **Pass `apiKey:` to `initialize()`** — the collector now authenticates via an
   `X-API-Key` header (omit it and the collector 401s). `endpoint` is now a
   **base URL**; the SDK posts to `<endpoint>/collector/telemetry`.
3. **Delete 4 removed symbols if you used them** (all OTel-leak / long-deprecated
   — see 💥 below): `startSpan()`, `endSpan()`, `activeScreenSpans`,
   `initialize(runAppCallback:)`. Crash handlers now install automatically.

Everything else compiles unchanged. `withSpan` / `withNetworkSpan` /
`useJsonFormat:` are kept as deprecated no-ops (removed in v3.0.0); your one
`navigationObserver` wiring line is untouched. **What you gain:** native crash
visibility, family-aligned dashboards (Flutter sessions render beside native
ones), a real 5-second flush (was a latent 5-*minute* default), offline
durability for all telemetry (was crash-only), and no dead OTel weight.

> **Ship gate.** v2.0.0's wire + backend-accommodation asks require
> **backend-team sign-off** (spec #15 §10 / #30) — engineering-green does not
> ship alone. On-device native-crash e2e is verified on a device matrix
> post-merge (#29 deviation). Both are tracked outside this changelog.

### 💥 Breaking (source break on upgrade)
- **REMOVED**: `startSpan()` / `endSpan()` — returned/consumed the deleted OTel
  `Span` type.
- **REMOVED**: `EdgeNavigationObserver.activeScreenSpans` and its
  `registerScreenSpan()` / `onSpanStart` / `onSpanEnd` constructor params.
- **REMOVED**: `initialize(runAppCallback:)` — deprecated in 1.5.2 with a
  stated "removed in v2.0.0"; crash handlers install automatically.

### ⚠️ Deprecated (now no-ops, removed in v3.0.0)
- `initialize(useJsonFormat:)` — ignored; the SDK is custom-JSON only.
- `withSpan()` / `withNetworkSpan()` — just run your function, record nothing.
- Each warns once per process when `debugMode` is on.

### 🆔 Identity contract (Phase 3)
- **CHANGED**: device/session/user IDs now carry 64-bit entropy via
  `Random.secure()` in the canon family format —
  `device_<epochMs>_<16hex>_<platform>`, `session_<epochMs>_<16hex>_<platform>`,
  `user_<epochMs>_<16hex>`. Was 8-char (device/user) / bare-16 (session).
- **CHANGED**: `device.id` is now stored in `flutter_secure_storage` (iOS
  Keychain survives reinstall) instead of `SharedPreferences`. New dependency:
  `flutter_secure_storage: ^9.2.4`.
- **ADDED**: `sdk.platform` attribute = `flutter-<os>`; `device.platform`
  remains the real OS.
- The device-ID validator accepts BOTH the legacy 8-alnum and new 16-hex random
  widths, so IDs minted before this release upgrade in place. `user.id` stays
  stable across `setUserProfile()` / reinstall-only regeneration.

### 📡 Wire flip to family canon (Phase 3) — **breaking wire change**
- **CHANGED**: batch envelope is now `type: "telemetry_batch"` (was `"batch"`),
  fields ordered `type`/`timestamp`/`batch_size`/`events`.
- **CHANGED**: transport POSTs to `<endpoint>/collector/telemetry` with an
  `X-API-Key` header. `endpoint` is now a **base URL** — new `apiKey:` param on
  `initialize()` supplies the key (omit → header not sent; the Collector 401s).
- **CHANGED**: the wire now carries **only the 12-event / 4-metric canon
  allowlist**. Event renames: `navigation.route_change`→`navigation`,
  `performance.screen_duration` (metric)→`screen.duration` (event),
  `performance.app_startup`→`page_load`, `network.connectivity_change`→
  `network_change`; host `trackEvent(name)`→`custom_event` (name in
  `event.name`); the `user.profile_*` trio folds into one `user.profile.update`.
- **CHANGED**: metric renames `performance.frame_time`→`frame_render_time`,
  `performance.memory_usage`→`memory_usage`, `performance.frame_drop` (event)→
  `long_task` (metric).
- **REMOVED from wire**: `http.error` / `http.slow_request` (fold into
  `http.request`), the 4 internal-noise events (`telemetry.initialized`,
  `*.monitor_initialized`, `performance.system_check`), and the
  `network.quality_score` / `http.response_time` / `performance.startup_time`
  metrics.
- **GUARANTEED**: `location` / `tenant_id` / `geo` are never sent (stripped at
  the context boundary — the Collector injects them). Batches are capped at
  1000 events.
- **CHANGED (crash unification)**: the bare `type:"error"` item is gone — every
  Dart error path (`FlutterError.onError`, `PlatformDispatcher.onError`,
  `runZonedGuarded`, the now-wired isolate error-listener, host `trackError`)
  funnels into one immediate `app.crash` **event** with **unprefixed** keys
  (`message`, `stacktrace`, `exception_type`, `cause="Error"`, `is_fatal=false`)
  and the catching handler in the secondary `crash.source`
  (`flutter_error`/`platform_dispatcher`/`zone`/`isolate`). The client no longer
  derives `crash_hash` / `severity` / `breadcrumbs` — the server computes those.
  Crashes still send immediately and persist+drain on network failure.
- **CHANGED (config)**: `batchSize` / `flushIntervalMs` / `sampleRate` are the
  canon keys; `flushIntervalMs` **defaults to 5000ms** (fixes the latent 5-min
  flush). Old `eventBatchSize` / `batchTimeout` / `maxBatchSize` are deprecated
  (still honored as fallbacks, removed in v3.0.0).

### 🛟 Reliability rail (Phase 3)
- **ADDED**: normal batches now persist on send failure (was crash-only). The
  `OfflineQueue` is one-file-per-batch under
  `<app documents>/edge_telemetry_queue/` — the assembled payload is stored
  verbatim, and draining lists files lexically (== FIFO), POSTs each, and
  deletes on 2xx. No on-device dedup.
- **ADDED**: `RetryTransport` batch backoff `[0, 2s, 8s, 30s]` — a reachable
  failure exhausts the schedule before queueing; an offline result
  (`status == 0`) hands off to the queue immediately.
- **ADDED**: `maxQueueSize` config knob (default 200) — batches drop-oldest
  past the cap; crashes (`crash_` filename prefix) are exempt and never dropped.

### 🎚️ Two-axis sampling (Phase 3)
- **ADDED**: `sampleRate` (config, default 1.0) is now live — rolled **once per
  session** and stored as `session.sampled`. A sampled-out session drops its
  subject-to-sample events coherently (whole session or none). At 1.0 there is
  no roll and `session.sampled` is omitted (wire unchanged).
- **ADDED**: send-priority (immediate vs batched) and sampling (bypass vs
  subject-to-sample) are now orthogonal axes. `app.crash` and the `session.*`
  bookends are immediate+bypass; `user.profile.update` is **batched-but-bypass**
  — an identity mutation always lands even in a sampled-out session.

### 🍞 Breadcrumbs & Flutter diagnostics (Phase 3)
- **CHANGED**: the breadcrumb ring is now **20 entries**, crash-scoped. It is
  attached to every `app.crash` as `crash.breadcrumbs` (JSON-encoded) and never
  appears in the global snapshot. Auto-crumbs now come from navigation, HTTP
  (sanitized **path only** — no query string), and lifecycle transitions;
  `addBreadcrumb(message, {category, level, data})` adds manual ones.
- **ADDED**: `frame_render_time` now carries `build_time_ms` (UI-thread build)
  and `raster_time_ms` (GPU raster) — the UI-vs-GPU jank split.
- **ADDED**: `navigation` and `screen.duration` carry `route.type` and
  `route.has_arguments` (**boolean only** — argument values are never captured).
- **CHANGED**: `page_load` now carries `startup.type` (`cold`/`warm`) and
  `startup.time_to_first_frame_ms`. The latter is **SDK-init-relative** — it
  undercounts everything before `initialize()`, so call it as early as possible
  in `main()`.
- **ADDED**: `app_lifecycle` carries `lifecycle.state` (raw `AppLifecycleState`).
- **ADDED**: every event carries `device.platform_brightness` (`light`/`dark`).
  `device.text_scale_factor` / `device.reduce_motion` are **opt-in** behind the
  new `initialize(captureAccessibilityContext:)` flag (default `false`, pending
  privacy sign-off — they are accessibility-sensitive).

### 📱 Native crash capture — iOS (Phase 4)
- **ADDED**: iOS MetricKit plugin behind the `edge_telemetry/native_crash`
  channel. `MXCrashDiagnostic` → `cause: NativeCrash`, `MXHangDiagnostic` →
  `cause: Hang`, both `is_fatal: true`, `crash.source: metrickit`. Zero
  hand-rolled signal handlers — Apple's supported diagnostic API only.
  Payloads are cached on device and drained on next launch via
  `drainNativeCrashes()`; MetricKit self-dedups and the drain reads-then-clears,
  so an OS crash record is never re-read across launches. Raw call-stack JSON is
  sent for server-side symbolication (no dSYM shipped in the SDK).
- **⚠️ BUILD BREAK**: the package is now an iOS plugin with a **hard iOS 14
  floor** (MetricKit diagnostics require it). Consumers must set
  `platform :ios, '14.0'` (or higher) in their `Podfile`. Android native
  capture ships separately.

### 📱 Native crash capture — Android (Phase 4)
- **ADDED**: Kotlin plugin behind the same `edge_telemetry/native_crash`
  channel. JVM/Kotlin crashes via `Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler`
  on **all** API levels (persist-then-chain, `crash.source: uncaught_handler`);
  native + ANR crashes via `ActivityManager.getHistoricalProcessExitReasons`
  (`ApplicationExitInfo`) on **API 30+** — `REASON_CRASH_NATIVE` →
  `cause: NativeCrash`, `REASON_ANR` → `cause: ANR`, `crash.source:
  app_exit_info`. Zero watchdogs, zero signal handlers. `REASON_CRASH` (JVM)
  from `ApplicationExitInfo` is ignored so JVM crashes aren't double-reported.
- **ADDED**: `sdk.native_capture_tier` on every Android crash payload — `full`
  on API 30+ (JVM + native + ANR), `jvm_only` below (native/ANR is a documented
  gap; the `ApplicationExitInfo` API doesn't exist pre-30). Per-device coverage
  is honest on the dashboard.
- A persisted watermark (last-seen exit timestamp) prevents re-reading OS exit
  records across launches; JVM crash files are read-then-deleted on drain. Raw
  tombstone / ANR traces are sent for server-side symbolication.
- **No minimum-SDK bump** — the existing low floor is preserved
  (`ApplicationExitInfo` is runtime-guarded for API 30+).

### 📱 Native crash convergence (Phase 4)
- **CHANGED**: `drainNativeCrashes()` — pulled once on init — now **routes** each
  native payload into the immediate `app.crash` rail (was contract-only, dropped
  the drain). Native crashes surface as `app.crash` with the OS-supplied `cause`
  (`NativeCrash` / `ANR` / `Hang`), `is_fatal: true`, `crash.source`, and the
  `sdk.native_capture_tier` passthrough carried verbatim — the client synthesizes
  none of it. Identity context is folded in downstream by the Collector; the send
  bypasses the batch (immediate rail).
- **FIXED**: Android `mapExit` signature/call-site mismatch that prevented the
  Kotlin plugin from compiling (`exception_type` now the named `REASON_*` string).
- **Deviation (device-matrix e2e, #29)**: the Dart convergence + routing is
  verified by unit tests (collector → wire, `cause`/`is_fatal`/`sdk.native_capture_tier`
  asserted), but the on-device e2e fatal (iOS MetricKit + Android
  `ApplicationExitInfo` producing `app.crash` on the wire) is **not yet run** —
  no device matrix / CI harness available at this stage. Contingency (spec #15
  Phase 4): if native slips, ship wire-first as v2.0.0 and native as v2.1.0
  (reopens #10). Not triggered — the wiring is in; only device-matrix
  confirmation is outstanding.

### 🧹 Internal
- **REMOVED**: `opentelemetry` dependency, `SpanManager`, `EventTrackerImpl`,
  the `EventTracker` interface, and the `useJsonFormat` dual-backend branches.
- **ADDED**: `NativeCrashChannel` — the pull-only `edge_telemetry/native_crash`
  MethodChannel contract (`drainNativeCrashes()` + documented per-crash payload
  schema) the Phase-4 iOS/Android native plugin builds against. Drained once on
  init and routed to `app.crash` (see Native crash convergence). Internal seam,
  not exported.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-10

Backward-compatible cleanup release. Wire format and public API are unchanged
from 1.5.2 — this is a safe drop-in upgrade.

### 🧹 Cleanup & leak fixes
- **FIXED**: `EdgeTelemetry.dispose()` now tears down the event tracker —
  previously the JSON batch timeout `Timer`, the crash-retry `Timer`, and the
  underlying `HttpClient` connection pool were leaked on shutdown.
- **CHANGED**: `EventTracker` interface gained a `dispose()` method
  (internal `lib/src/` type — not part of the public API).
- **REMOVED**: Dead empty file `lib/src/telemetry/edge_telemetry.dart`.
- **REMOVED**: Dead unreachable null-aware fallback on `idleTimeout` in the
  HTTP override.

Wire traffic and dispose-time behaviour are unchanged from 1.5.2 (buffered
events are still dropped on shutdown; flush-on-dispose is deferred to 2.0.0).

## [1.5.2] - 2025-08-29

### 🔧 Critical Error Logging Fix

#### Always-On Error Report Logging
- **FIXED**: Error report logging now always shows, regardless of debug mode setting
- **FIXED**: Enhanced visibility for error telemetry transmission status
- **IMPROVED**: Critical error information is no longer hidden behind debug flags

#### Changes Made
- **JsonEventTracker**: Always logs error report success/failure and offline storage
- **EventTrackerImpl**: Always logs OpenTelemetry error report transmission
- **CrashRetryManager**: Always logs retry attempts and results
- Removed debug mode dependency for error report logging visibility

#### Why This Fix Was Needed
- Error report transmission is critical information developers need to see
- Previous version only showed logging when `debugMode: true` was set
- This caused confusion when error telemetry appeared to not be working
- Error logging should always be visible for debugging and verification

### 🎯 Impact
- **Better Developer Experience**: Immediate visibility when errors are captured and sent
- **Easier Debugging**: No need to enable debug mode to see error telemetry status
- **Production Visibility**: Error transmission status visible in all environments
- **Troubleshooting**: Clear feedback when error reports succeed or fail

## [1.5.1] - 2025-08-29
